# Code of Conduct
The Homebrew, Tigerbrew, and (someday) Leopardbrew communities are made up of members from around the globe with a diverse set of skills, personalities, and
experiences.  It is through these differences that our communities experience great successes and continued growth.  When you’re working with members of such
communities, we encourage you to follow these guidelines which help steer our interactions and strive to keep a positive, successful, and growing experience.

A member of this community is:

## Open
Members of the community are open to collaboration, whether on GitHub, email, IRC or otherwise.  We’re receptive to constructive comment and criticism, as the
experiences and skill sets of other members contribute to the whole of our efforts.  We’re accepting of all who wish to take part in our activities, fostering
an environment where anyone can participate and everyone can make a difference.

## Considerate
Members of the community are considerate of their peers – other ’brew users.  We’re thoughtful when addressing the efforts of others, keeping in mind that
oftentimes their labour was completed simply for the good of the community.  We’re attentive in our communications, whether in person or online, and we’re
tactful when approaching differing views.

## Respectful
Members of the community are respectful.  We’re respectful of others, their positions, their skills, their commitments, and their efforts.  We’re respectful of
the volunteer efforts that permeate the ’brew communities.  We're respectful of the processes set forth in the community, and we work within them.  When we
disagree, we are courteous in raising our issues.

Overall, we’re good to each other.  We contribute to this community not because we have to, but because we want to.  If we remember that, these guidelines will
come naturally.

# Diversity
The ’brew communities welcome and encourage participation by everyone.  Our communities are based on mutual respect, tolerance, and encouragement, and we are
working to help each other live up to these principles.  We want our community to be more diverse: whoever you are, and whatever your background, we welcome
you.

We have created this diversity statement because we believe that a diverse community is stronger and more vibrant.  A diverse community where people treat each
other with respect has more potential contributors and more sources for ideas.

Although we have phrased the formal diversity statement generically to make it all-inclusive, we recognise that there are specific attributes that are used to
discriminate against people.  In alphabetical order, some of these attributes include (but are not limited to):  age, culture, ethnicity, gender identity or
expression, national origin, physical or mental difference, politics, race, religion, sex, sexual orientation, socio-economic status, and subculture.  (Note
that none of those things are relevant to computer code.)  We welcome people regardless of the values of these or other attributes.
