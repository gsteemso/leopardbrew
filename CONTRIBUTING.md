# Contributing to Leopardbrew
## Reporting Bugs
First, please run `brew update` and `brew doctor`.

Second, read Tigerbrew’s [Troubleshooting Checklist](https://github.com/mistydemeo/tigerbrew/blob/master/share/doc/homebrew/Troubleshooting.md#troubleshooting).
It’s not perfectly applicable to Leopardbrew and will rapidly become less so, but it will suffice until I can get something together here.

**If you don't do these it will take far longer to help you with your problem.**

## Security
Mac OS 10.4 and 10.5 (Darwin 8 and 9) have been obsolete for more than a decade.  Inherently, neither is extremely secure.  If you’ve found something truly
egregious, are you sure it should be coming to me and not to whomever is responsible for the software in question?

## Contributing

Just remember that the links in there are for Misty De Méo’s _TIGERBREW_, not for my _LEOPARDBREW_.  Please don’t go bothering them about Leopardbrew.  It’s
nothing to do with them and they cannot help you here.
