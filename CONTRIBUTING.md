# Contributing to Leopardbrew
## Reporting Bugs
First, please run `brew update` and `brew doctor`.

Second, read Tigerbrew’s [Troubleshooting Checklist][tslist].  It’s not
perfectly applicable to Leopardbrew and will rapidly become less so, but it
will suffice until I can get something together here.

**If you don’t do these, it will take far longer to help you with your
problem.**

## Security
Mac OS 10.4 & 10.5 (Darwin 8 & 9) have been obsolete for well over a decade.
Inherently, neither is extremely secure, and attempts to correct that involve a
lot of different software packages.  If you’ve found something truly egregious,
are you really sure it should be coming to me?

## Contributing
Until I can get something together locally, please refer to these Tigerbrew
documents – but remember that they are _TIGERBREW_ documents, whose authors
have probably never heard of _LEOPARDBREW_.  Please don’t go bothering them
about Leopardbrew stuff they have no connection with.

Again, the links in there are for Misty De Méo’s _TIGERBREW_, not for my
_LEOPARDBREW_.  Please don’t go bothering the nice folks about Leopardbrew.
It’s nothing to do with them and they cannot help you here.
