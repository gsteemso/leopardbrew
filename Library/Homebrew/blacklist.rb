        Clojure isn’t really a program but a library managed as part of a
        project, and Leiningen is the user interface to that library.

        To install Clojure you should install Leiningen:
            brew install leiningen
        and then follow the tutorial:
            https://github.com/technomancy/leiningen/blob/stable/doc/TUTORIAL.md

        Installing gmock system-wide is not recommended; it should be vendored

    when 'haskell-platform' then <<-EOS.undent
        We no longer package haskell-platform. Consider installing ghc
        and cabal-install instead:
            brew install ghc cabal-install

        A binary installer is available:

        The creator of Osmium requests that it not be packaged and that people

    when 'pip', 'pip3' then <<-EOS.undent
        Homebrew provides pip via `brew install python` and pip3 via
        `brew install python3`.  If your system Python is new enough you don’t want to
        do that, alternatively you can `sudo easy_install pip`.

        Play 2.3 replaces the play command with activator:
            brew install typesafe-activator

        We won’t add sshpass because it makes it too easy for novice SSH users to
        ruin SSH’s security.

        Installing TeX from source is weird and gross, requires a lot of patches,
        and only builds 32-bit (and thus can’t use Homebrew deps on Snow Leopard.)

        We recommend using a MacTeX distribution: https://www.tug.org/mactex/
